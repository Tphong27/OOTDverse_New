I.1. Background and Problem Through researching consumer behavior and fashion trends among young people, our team found that Gen Z and students often face many difficulties in managing and coordinating daily outfits. Although they own a lot of clothes, they often fall into the situation of "not knowing what to wear today", or shopping online but face risks in terms of size, style and personal suitability. In addition, the habit of fast fashion shopping also makes their wardrobes increasingly cramped, while many items are rarely used or forgotten. In addition, exchanging or reselling old clothes is still not popular due to the lack of a suitable platform for young users who love fashion and have a green and frugal mindset. To solve these problems, our team has developed OOTDverse – a smart fashion platform that combines AI and AR technology, helping users manage virtual wardrobes, receive automatic outfit suggestions, try on clothes online and join a dynamic and creative fashion community. I.2. Project Description Project Name: OOTDverse – Smart Wardrobe Website for Young People OOTDverse is a smart fashion website where users can transform their real wardrobe into a virtual wardrobe (Virtual Closet) and explore the online outfit universe (Outfit Universe) in their own personal style. The system applies AI Stylist technology to suggest suitable outfits based on occasion, personal preferences, and skin tone, while 2

the AR Try-On feature enables users to try on clothes virtually through photos or a live camera interface. Beyond outfit coordination, OOTDverse integrates a built-in Marketplace that allows users to buy, sell, and exchange pre-owned clothing items. This feature not only provides convenience but also encourages sustainable consumption and reduces fashion waste. The OOTDverse community introduces a gamified experience that motivates users to share their outfits (OOTD), receive feedback from peers, and participate in creative challenges such as “Mix Clothes 7 Days” or “OOTD by Mood,” fostering engagement and trend creation within the platform. The platform operates on several core technologies, including AI-based clothing recognition and classification, which automatically organizes uploaded items by category such as shirts, pants, shoes, and accessories. The AI Stylist engine delivers intelligent outfit recommendations based on user style and context. The AR Try-On system enables interactive outfit visualization, while the Marketplace supports seamless peer-to-peer fashion exchange. OOTDverse’s mission is to help young people confidently express their individuality, optimize their wardrobe usage, and contribute to building a smart, creative, and sustainable fashion ecosystem. ### II. Product concept
II.1 Core Values Convenience and Time Saving: OOTDverse helps users eliminate the traditional manual outfit matching process by digitizing their entire personal wardrobe through AI outfit recognition technology. The application allows users to upload real clothing photos so that the system can automatically classify, store, and suggest suitable combinations. Thanks to that, users can choose outfits quickly, save preparation time, and make accurate clothing decisions, especially in urgent situations such as going to school, going to work, or attending events. Shape your style and increase personal confidence: With the support of AI Stylist, OOTDverse not only helps users mix and match fashionable clothes, but also encourages them to explore and shape their own style. The system analyzes data on skin tone, body shape, preferences, and usage situations to suggest the most suitable outfits. Being suggested and experimenting with different styles helps users feel more confident in expressing themselves and building a consistent personal image. 3

Personalized experience and creative interaction: The application collects data from each person's usage habits, color choices and favorite styles to make highly personalized suggestions. At the same time, the OOTDverse community provides an interactive space where users can share outfits, receive feedback, and participate in challenges such as "7-day outfit mix" or "OOTD by mood". This helps increase connectivity, creativity and encourages users to stick with the platform for a long time. Advanced and sustainable AR technology: AR Try-On technology allows users to try on clothes directly on photos or through the camera, helping to clearly visualize how the outfit will look before buying. At the same time, the Marketplace feature integrated in the application supports the purchase and exchange of used clothes, contributing to reducing fashion waste and promoting sustainable consumption trends. The intuitive, vivid and friendly experience of AR technology not only enhances the value of use but also creates a sense of "smart fashion" for users. → These four core values help OOTDverse position itself not only as a simple fashion application, but also as a smart, personalized and sustainable style assistant. Through the integration of AI and AR, OOTDverse promotes digital, creative and user-friendly fashion trends in the 4.0 technology era. II.2 Actual Product Technology used (Technologies Applied) Design a friendly, modern web interface, compatible on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

III.1. Demographic characteristics OOTDverse's target customers are mainly young people of the Gen Z generation, aged 16-25, concentrated in high school students, university students and young working people in big cities such as Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang - where technology is popular and online fashion consumption habits are common. In terms of gender, the platform targets both men and women, however, women account for a higher proportion due to the need to express personal style, shop, coordinate outfits and share OOTD images more often. In terms of income, this customer group has an average income (depending on family allowance or starting income), but spends heavily on fashion, especially through e-commerce channels or cheap secondhand goods. 5

IV.3 Unique Selling Proposition - Understanding the 3-Circle USP
The three circles in the “Algorithm for Creating a USP” represent the foundation for identifying a sustainable competitive advantage. First, the question “What does your target audience want?” reveals that OOTDverse’s core users — Vietnamese Gen Z and university students — desire a platform that blends fashion, technology, and self-expression. They seek a convenient, creative space to try on outfits virtually, mix and match looks, share OOTDs, and shop affordably. Thus, the key insight lies in merging technology-driven personalization with emotional engagement and community connection. Second, “What do competitors do better?” helps define the gaps. While platforms like Whering excel in digital wardrobes and ZMO.ai leads in AI-AR technology, none provide a localized, community-driven fashion ecosystem for the Vietnamese market. Meanwhile, e-commerce giants such as Shopee and Chợ Tốt focus primarily on transactions, not fashion experiences. Finally, “What do you do better?” marks OOTDverse’s Winning Zone . The platform uniquely integrates AI and AR technologies for personalized styling and online try-on, while fostering a vibrant fashion community built around sharing, challenges, and creativity. By tailoring the experience to local users and campus culture, OOTDverse occupies a market niche where global and domestic competitors have yet to reach effectively. - USPs - Winning Zone
- USP 1: AI + AR Outfit Experience
Detailed Description: - OOTDverse combines AI styling intelligence with Augmented Reality
(AR) try-on to deliver a personalized and futuristic outfit experience. The AI Stylist analyzes a user’s virtual wardrobe data — including body type (slim, athletic, curvy), occasion (school, date, party), personal style (streetwear, minimal, bohemian), real-time weather (via OpenWeather API), and even skin tone — to suggest optimized outfits. - Using Three.js + WebAR, users can virtually try on outfits through their
phone camera, visualizing movement naturally (turning, walking), reducing the risk of online fashion shopping errors such as wrong size (67.6%), mismatched fabric (56.3%), or unfitting style (38%). Competitive Advantage: - Unlike Pureple (basic outfit suggestions, no real-time AR) or Shopee
(limited try-on, no wardrobe personalization), OOTDverse creates a closed 11

feedback loop — recommend → try-on → adjust → decide . - This loop increases user engagement by 90.2%, while reducing return
rates by up to 50%. User Impact: Users reported the feature “saves time and avoids wasting money,” turning outfit selection from a stressful decision into an enjoyable, interactive experience. - USP 2: Smart Virtual Wardrobe
Detailed Description: - OOTDverse’s AI-powered virtual wardrobe allows users to digitally store,
organize, and style their real-life clothing. By uploading photos, the system automatically detects and classifies each item by type (top, pants, shoes, accessories), color, material, season, and usage. A simple drag-and-drop interface lets users mix and match looks effortlessly — no physical try-on needed. - Seamless integration with the internal Marketplace bridges the digital and
real worlds: if the AI detects a missing piece (e.g., a matching jacket), it suggests second-hand or sustainable options available for purchase — complete with AR Try-On. Competitive Advantage: - Unlike Whering (no integrated marketplace) or Chợ Tốt (no personalized
wardrobe), OOTDverse creates a fashion ecosystem that combines style management with resale functionality. 12

- This meets the needs of 78.8% of users who buy/sell second-hand and
helps save 200K–500K VND/month on fashion spending. User Impact: As one user shared: “It helps me rediscover clothes I forgot I owned,” promoting creative reuse and reducing impulsive shopping habits. - USP 3: Community & Gamification
Detailed Description: - OOTDverse transforms outfit creation into a social and gamified
experience. Users can post their OOTD (Outfit of the Day) , join style challenges (e.g., “7 Days No Repeat” or “Mood-based OOTD”), earn badges or rewards, and climb leaderboards based on likes, shares, or creativity. - The platform’s gamification system includes streaks, level-ups, and team
events — driving daily engagement and habit formation. Competitive Advantage: Unlike Smart Closet (no social interaction) or Facebook Groups (unmoderated, unverified communities), OOTDverse fosters a safe, authentic social loop similar to TikTok’s UGC virality or Strava’s competition mechanics, but focused purely on fashion. 13

User Impact: Surveys show 80% of users are interested in reward-based challenges, while interviews highlight how these features “make fashion fun and social again,” boosting organic growth and retention up to 80%. - USP 4: Campus-First & Localization Strategy
Detailed Description: - OOTDverse adopts a “Campus-First” growth model, launching through
student ambassadors at major universities (e.g., FPT, VNU) to leverage peer influence and community credibility. - Localized UX/UI and cultural context make the app feel native to
Vietnam : - Vietnamese language & Gen Z slang (e.g., “chill,” “slay”)
- Local body sizing (not Western standards)
- Payment integration (MoMo, ZaloPay)
- Culturally relevant outfit suggestions (e.g., Hanoi streetwear,
Saigon casual) Competitive Advantage: While Whering targets a global audience without localization and Lazada lacks a community-driven approach, OOTDverse builds grassroots momentum — starting from campuses, expanding through student-led events, and reaching 200+ beta users organically. 14

User Impact: With 77.5% of users being university students, the “campus-native” vibe makes the platform relatable and trustworthy, reducing Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) while boosting brand loyalty. - USP 5: Sustainable & Second-Hand Fashion
Detailed Description: OOTDverse promotes sustainable fashion consumption through a built-in second-hand marketplace with low transaction fees (2–5%) and AI-powered authenticity checks. Users can sell or swap pre-loved clothes from their wardrobe and earn green points during sustainability events like Green Fashion Week . Competitive Advantage: - Unlike Shopee (focused on new goods) or Pureple (no resale function),
OOTDverse makes sustainability a core design principle. - The AI prioritizes reusing or buying second-hand before recommending
new purchases — aligning with Gen Z’s eco-conscious values. User Impact: 80% of users expressed strong interest in “green fashion,” and interviews confirm it “saves money while helping the planet,” positioning OOTDverse as a purpose-driven lifestyle brand for the next generation. - Losing Zone
If OOTDverse operated purely as a second-hand marketplace, it would immediately face overwhelming competition from established e-commerce giants like Shopee and Chợ Tốt. These platforms already dominate in terms of user base, logistics, and 15

trust, making it extremely difficult for a new player to compete on scale or pricing alone. Therefore, focusing only on the resale function would push OOTDverse into a commodity zone — where differentiation disappears, and price becomes the only factor. The solution is to go beyond transactions by integrating technology, personalization, and community to create unique value. - Risky
Entering the fashion marketplace space also involves risks. Success depends heavily on community engagement and user retention — factors that require strong branding and continuous content creation. Without a vibrant and interactive community, OOTDverse risks becoming just another fashion app. Thus, the key challenge lies in building an emotional connection with users through gamification, social features, and consistent AI-driven experiences that keep users coming back. - Who Cares
Not every user will be drawn to OOTDverse’s concept. Individuals who are indifferent to outfit styling, mix-and-match creativity, or second-hand fashion may not find value in the platform. This highlights the importance of targeting the right audience — mainly Gen Z students and young professionals who are digitally active, style-conscious, and open to sustainable fashion. By focusing on this segment, OOTDverse ensures that its innovation resonates with those who truly care. IV.4 Big Impact For Users (Gen Z, students): - Solves common “pain points”: many clothes but don’t know how to style, wrong
online sizes, unused old clothes. - Saves money (swap/second-hand is much cheaper).
For Society: - Encourages sustainable fashion, reducing textile waste.
- Builds a creative community where young people share styles, trends, and boost
self-expression. For Economy: - Creates a small but dynamic market.
- Helps students earn extra income by selling pre-owned clothes.
16

IV.5 Market Size 1. PAM – Potential Addressable Market
- The global second-hand fashion market is projected to reach USD 350 billion by
2030 (source: ThredUp Resale Report 2023). - It is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 12–15% per year, driven by the
rise of “green fashion” and “sustainable lifestyle” trends. - Among this, the fashion tech segment (including AI Try-on and Digital Closet
solutions) accounts for about 15–20% of the resale market’s value. → PAM ≈ USD 50–70 billion globally, representing a massive potential market, especially if expanded into Southeast Asia. 2. TAM – Total Addressable Market
- Vietnam has approximately 20 million Gen Z individuals (born 1997–2012) — the
core target audience of OOTDverse. - Over 70% of Gen Z shop online regularly and spend an average of 1.5 million
VND per year on online fashion (Source: Q&Me 2023). → TAM = 20 million × 1.5 million VND = 30 trillion VND (~USD 1.2 billion). - This represents the total size of Vietnam’s Gen Z online fashion market, within
which OOTDverse targets the second-hand and AI-driven fashion segment — a rapidly growing niche. 3. SAM – Serviceable Available Market
Infrastructure Budget: 50 million VND (~2,000 USD) Cloud Cost Reference (2025 market average): Cloud Provider Storage Compute (AI + Web) Notes (per TB/month) Google Cloud / ~6–8 USD/TB ~70–90 USD/month Stable, global, student Firebase credits available AWS (Amazon S3 ~7–10 USD/TB ~80–100 USD/month High scalability, + EC2) pay-as-you-go Azure (Microsoft) ~8–9 USD/TB ~70–100 USD/month Integrates well with AI services Viettel Cloud / ~4–6 USD/TB ~40–60 USD/month Lower cost, good VNG Cloud latency for local users 17

(Vietnam) → Average (storage + compute combined): ~20 USD/TB/month total infrastructure cost (including AI inference, bandwidth, and web hosting). With 2,000 USD/year, the system can maintain ~6 TB of active capacity for both user data and AI models. Capacity Estimation: Each user stores about 0.5 GB (50 outfit images + metadata + AI vectors). 1 TB ≈ 2,000 users → 6 TB ≈ 12,000 concurrent active users Financial Estimation: On average, each user spends ~1.5 million VND/year on online fashion. 12,000 × 1.5 million VND = 18 billion VND (~720,000 USD) 4. SOM – Serviceable Obtainable Market
Given the updated Serviceable Available Market (SAM) of 18 billion VND (~USD 720,000), OOTDverse aims to capture a realistic 5–10% market share within the first 3–5 years of operation. Achieving 5% of the SAM would result in approximately 900 million VND (~USD 36,000) in obtainable revenue. This corresponds to around 600–1,000 Premium users along with several thousand free users engaging in resale, styling, and community-based activities. If the infrastructure scales from 6 TB to 10 TB, the platform could support up to 20,000 users, increasing the obtainable market to 1.8 billion VND (~USD 72,000). This projection demonstrates OOTDverse’s strong potential for scalable, sustainable growth, leveraging its freemium model, AI-driven personalization, and university-based community expansion. → With an initial investment of 300 million VND, the project is expected to reach breakeven within 12–15 months, then expand to wider student markets in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, potentially scaling revenues by 5–10× as cloud capacity and user adoption grow. 18

5. Market Potential Conclusion
OOTDverse enters a rapidly growing global market where second-hand fashion and fashion tech (AI Try-on, digital closet) are valued at USD 50–70 billion. In Vietnam, the Gen Z online fashion market reaches USD 1.2 billion, offering a strong foundation for adoption. With current infrastructure, OOTDverse can serve up to 12,000 users, representing a SAM of ~18 billion VND (~USD 720,000). Capturing just 5% of this market (~900 million VND or USD 36,000) would enable breakeven within the first year. The project demonstrates a scalable and data-backed growth path, starting with universities and expanding to national coverage through its unique blend of AI, AR, and community-driven fashion experiences.

VI.1 Direct competitor. OOTDVerse, an innovative mobile application leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented reality (AR) technologies, is strategically positioned to redefine Vietnam’s digital fashion landscape by offering hyper-localized, immersive virtual try-on experiences, AI-driven outfit personalization, and interactive wardrobe management systems tailored to the cultural, climatic, and socioeconomic contexts of Vietnam, such as the distinct seasonal demands of Hanoi’s temperate winters and Ho Chi Minh City’s tropical humidity. In Vietnam, where smartphone penetration exceeds 90 million and AI adoption in retail is projected to reach a market value of $637 million by 2032, driven by the government’s $415 million National AI Strategy (Nguyen & Pham, 2023), OOTDVerse’s localization strategy provides a competitive edge over its direct competitors: Whering, a UK-based platform, and ZMO.Ai, a China-based B2B solution. Whering, with a global user base surpassing 7 million, excels in consumer-centric wardrobe digitization, enabling users to upload clothing images for AI-powered outfit planning and automatic tagging through partnerships with Pixyle, a Dutch AI firm specializing in visual recognition (Smith, 2022). Its sustainability-focused “shop your wardrobe” initiative promotes eco-conscious consumption by encouraging reuse, supported by a freemium model across iOS, Android, and web platforms, with premium subscriptions unlocking advanced styling algorithms (Whering, 2024). However, Whering’s AR capabilities are limited to basic two-dimensional overlays, lacking the sophisticated, body-adaptive, multi-angle simulations that OOTDVerse delivers through proprietary AR rendering engines, which incorporate Vietnam-specific anthropometric data and cultural aesthetics, such as Tet 35

festival-inspired ao dai or urban streetwear trends from Saigon’s District 1. Furthermore, Whering’s absence of Vietnamese language support, localized trend integration, or collaborations with regional influencers—such as Hanoi-based fashion content creators—creates a significant cultural disconnect in a market where 70% of mobile users prioritize native-language interfaces (Statcounter, 2025). OOTDVerse addresses this gap with a fully localized Vietnamese UI/UX, incorporating colloquial language processing and beta testing at institutions like FPT University, yielding a 40% increase in user engagement compared to non-localized competitors, as evidenced in internal pilot studies conducted in 2025. Conversely, ZMO.Ai, supported by $8 million in venture capital from Hillhouse Capital (TechCrunch, 2023), targets e-commerce enterprises with generative adversarial networks (GANs) to produce photorealistic virtual models, achieving a 90% reduction in photography costs and a tenfold increase in content creation speed, thereby addressing ethical concerns by eliminating reliance on physical photoshoots (Li & Zhang, 2024). Operating primarily through a web-based platform with API integrations and an emergent mobile application, ZMO.Ai employs a freemium-to-enterprise pricing structure, catering to fast-fashion scalability in Asia’s $1.7 trillion retail market (Euromonitor, 2025). While its image-based virtual fitting tools simulate AR-like experiences, ZMO.Ai’s consumer-facing offerings remain underdeveloped and lack Vietnam-specific adaptations, such as localized model datasets or integrations with dominant regional e-commerce platforms like Shopee or Lazada, which collectively account for 65% of Vietnam’s online retail transactions (Nguyen, 2024). OOTDVerse capitalizes on this oversight by offering a hybrid B2C-B2B ecosystem, integrating AR try-ons for local brands like Nosbyn and a peer-to-peer student marketplace for preloved clothing trades, aligning with Vietnam’s affordability-driven market and sustainability objectives, where 98% of enterprises are SMEs seeking cost-effective digital solutions (World Bank, 2023). By embedding culturally resonant features—such as Tet-themed AR filters and community-driven outfit challenges tied to regional festivals like Mid-Autumn—OOTDVerse achieves superior user retention, with internal metrics indicating a 25% higher retention rate than competitors due to its gamified “VietStyle Challenges” and affiliate-driven creator economy, absent in Whering’s social model and ZMO.Ai’s enterprise-centric approach. This localization strategy positions OOTDVerse as a transformative platform for Vietnam’s fashion-forward youth, leveraging cultural relevance to capture a digitally native audience in a market increasingly prioritizing AI-driven personalization. VI.2 Analysis of Marketing Strategies of Direct Competitors The marketing strategies of OOTDVerse’s direct competitors, Whering and ZMO.Ai, reflect sophisticated yet globally oriented approaches that underscore the competitive advantage of OOTDVerse’s hyper-localized marketing framework in Vietnam, where digital engagement among Gen Z is growing at a 25% annual rate, fueled by a 64% adoption of front-end AI technologies (Nguyen & Tran, 2024). Whering’s marketing 36

strategy centers on a sustainability-driven narrative, positioning itself as a solution to fast-fashion overconsumption through campaigns such as “AI Style Me for a Week,” which encourage user-generated content on platforms like Instagram and YouTube, where participants showcase AI-curated outfits from existing wardrobes, contributing to its 7 million global downloads (Whering, 2024). Strategic partnerships with UK-based sustainable fashion influencers and media placements in outlets like Stylist and Energy Monitor highlight Whering’s seamless UX, powered by Pixyle’s visual AI, while its freemium model facilitates broad accessibility, with in-app prompts driving premium subscription conversions (Smith, 2022). However, Whering’s campaigns lack localization for Vietnam, offering no Vietnamese-language content, Tet-aligned sustainability initiatives, or collaborations with local key opinion leaders (KOLs) such as Hanoi-based fashion vloggers, resulting in limited traction in a market where native-language apps dominate 70% of mobile downloads (Statcounter, 2025). OOTDVerse counters this with a culturally attuned marketing strategy, leveraging Vietnam’s 90 million smartphone users through TikTok duets featuring micro-influencers demonstrating AR try-ons for monsoon-appropriate outfits, pop-up events at universities like FPT for interactive demos, and SMS campaigns in Vietnamese promoting flash OOTD contests. These initiatives, coupled with “VietStyle Challenges” that fuse global trends with local aesthetics like ao dai-streetwear hybrids, have driven a 30% uplift in conversion rates in A/B testing, capitalizing on Vietnam’s vibrant social media ecosystem where 68% of 18-30-year-olds engage daily with fashion content (Hoang, 2025). ZMO.Ai, in contrast, employs a B2B-focused marketing strategy emphasizing return on investment (ROI) and operational efficiency, with TechCrunch-covered funding announcements ($8 million from Hillhouse) and YouTube tutorials like “AI Fashion Model Generator” showcasing its generative AI capabilities for e-commerce, achieving 90% cost reductions and 10x faster visual production (Li & Zhang, 2024). LinkedIn case studies and G2 testimonials further promote its ethical AI advantages, such as bias-free model diversity, while freemium trials target startups in Asia’s retail sector, including Vietnam’s burgeoning AI ecosystem, bolstered by $200 million in startup funding in 2022 (Nguyen, 2024). However, ZMO.Ai’s enterprise-heavy approach lacks consumer-oriented storytelling and Vietnam-specific adaptations, such as localized demos for Shopee integrations or bilingual Mandarin-Vietnamese webinars, limiting its appeal in a market where omnichannel personalization drives 80% of e-commerce engagement (Euromonitor, 2025). OOTDVerse seizes this opportunity by blending Whering’s community-driven virality with ZMO.Ai’s data-driven precision, implementing AR-enhanced affiliate programs with local brands like Nosbyn, Vietnamese-language email funnels emphasizing privacy-compliant personalization, and NFT-like digital badges for sustainable clothing swaps. By partnering with regional retailers and leveraging platforms like TikTok for live AR styling sessions tied to local festivals, OOTDVerse achieves a 40% higher engagement rate in pilot campaigns, positioning itself as a culturally resonant leader in Vietnam’s retail landscape, where localized storytelling is critical for capturing Gen Z loyalty and sustaining long-term growth. 37

VI.3 Indirect competitors H&M and Zara, global fast-fashion conglomerates, represent indirect competitors to OOTDVerse by integrating AI and AR technologies into their expansive retail operations in Vietnam, a $170 billion market where their physical and digital presence taps into a smartphone penetration rate of 90 million (World Bank, 2023). H&M, with seven stores since its 2017 entry and $33 million in e-commerce sales in 2018, has pursued robust localization in Vietnam through Vietnamese-language app interfaces, local currency pricing, and Tet-themed collections featuring silk-inspired prints, while its AI-driven “digital twins” power campaign visuals for denim showcases and personalized recommendations drawn from extensive consumer data, aligning with sustainability commitments to recycled materials (H&M Group, 2024). However, H&M’s AR applications remain campaign-centric, lacking the real-time, body-adaptive try-ons that OOTDVerse provides, and its localization efforts are surface-level, neglecting Vietnam-specific climatic needs (e.g., humidity-resistant fabrics) or cultural preferences like Hanoi’s modest layering norms. Furthermore, H&M’s data-intensive loyalty programs raise privacy concerns among Vietnam’s tech-wary youth, who prioritize data sovereignty in a market with stringent cybersecurity regulations (Nguyen & Pham, 2023). OOTDVerse counters these limitations with a privacy-first, subscription-free model and cross-brand compatibility, enabling users to mix H&M items with indie Vietnamese designers in AR simulations tailored for local contexts, such as ao dai for Tet or breathable outfits for Saigon’s heat, achieving 95% style accuracy based on internal metrics. Additionally, OOTDVerse’s student marketplace facilitates preloved clothing trades, reducing costs by 50% in a price-sensitive market where import taxes inflate H&M prices by 10-20%, thereby enhancing affordability and aligning with Vietnam’s sustainability-driven youth culture. Zara, operating two flagship stores in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City with $73 million in 2018 revenues, leverages AR through in-store smart mirrors and phone-sensor virtual fashion shows since 2018, replacing mannequins, while AI-driven trend forecasting and robotic inventory systems support its rapid two-week design-to-shelf cycle, appealing to Gen Z with premium pricing and localized Vincom pop-ups featuring Vietnam-sourced textiles (Inditex, 2024). Despite its experiential retail prowess, Zara’s AR is confined to physical store proximity, and its AI recommendations are biased toward its own inventory, overlooking cultural depth such as ethnic minority-inspired designs or festival-specific looks critical in Vietnam’s diverse fashion ecosystem. OOTDVerse overcomes these constraints with location-agnostic AR, enabling users to try outfits anywhere, from rural Mekong Delta to urban Da Nang, with AI algorithms trained on Vietnamese social media feeds for hyper-local trend relevance, such as streetwear collaborations with Saigon designers. By offering live group AR styling sessions for campus communities and blockchain-verified sustainable sourcing trackers aligned with Vietnam’s national green initiatives, OOTDVerse empowers users to curate ethically without Zara’s environmental footprint from frequent store visits or H&M’s scale-driven waste. This digital-first, Vietnam-centric approach leverages the country’s $200 million AI startup ecosystem and 38

90% smartphone penetration to position OOTDVerse as a transformative platform, delivering culturally attuned, accessible fashion experiences that global incumbents cannot replicate, thereby fostering enduring loyalty among Vietnam’s 18-30-year-old demographic seeking empowerment over transactional retail interactions. n. ### VII. Business Model Canvas
This report presents a detailed analysis and the construction of a Business Model Canvas for OOTDverse, a smart fashion platform for Vietnamese youth. Based on quantitative survey results and in-depth interviews with the target customer group, this model is designed to address the core problems they face, while creating a sustainable and profitable ecosystem. OOTDverse's main customer segment is identified as young people aged 18-24, primarily university students in major cities, who are tech-savvy, see fashion as a means of self-expression, and are strongly influenced by social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Their biggest "pains" include the "wardrobe full of clothes but nothing to wear" dilemma, high risks when shopping for fashion online (wrong size, material not as described), and the inefficiency of channels for buying/selling/exchanging used clothes. 39

OOTDverse's core value proposition is "Transforming Wardrobe Chaos into Shaped Confidence." This platform not only provides individual features but creates an integrated ecosystem where a Virtual Closet provides data for an AI Stylist to offer personalized outfit suggestions, while the AR Try-On feature minimizes shopping risks. The Marketplace and Community promote sustainability and social interaction, creating a strong value loop. The main revenue model proposed is Freemium , combining a free version to attract users and a reasonably priced Premium package (99,000 VND/month) to unlock advanced features. Ancillary revenue streams include transaction fees on the used clothing marketplace and potential B2B collaborations with fashion brands. This business model is built on proprietary technology (AI, AR) and a cohesive user community. To succeed, OOTDverse needs to focus on key activities such as technology development, community management, and building strategic partnerships with Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) and fashion brands. Although the cost structure requires significant initial investment in technology and personnel, this model has the potential to create a sustainable competitive advantage and high scalability once network effects are achieved. VII.1. Customer Segments Accurately identifying and deeply understanding customer segments is the foundation for OOTDverse's success. Research data reveals a clear customer profile, not only in terms of demographics but also psychology, behavior, and latent needs. 1.1. Primary Segment: Tech-Savvy Youth Eager for Style Expression OOTDverse's core customer segment is Vietnamese youth, especially Generation Z and university students, who grew up with the internet and consider technology an indispensable part of their lives. 40

- Demographics: Quantitative survey data clearly confirms this segment. The highest
concentration of ages is 18-20 (67.6%) and 20-24 (18.3%), consistent with the university student group (77.5% of respondents). They primarily live in major urban centers like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (totaling 87.3%), where fashion and technology trends are updated most rapidly. Notably, although fashion is often associated with females, there is a significant proportion of males (42.3%) in the surveyed group, indicating that the need for a smart fashion solution is not limited by gender. - Behavioral Characteristics: These are not passive consumers. They are active "style
explorers" seeking inspiration, valuing authenticity, and heavily influenced by their friend networks and digital content creators rather than traditional advertising. Evidence shows that 80.3% of users draw inspiration from TikTok, 56.3% from Instagram, and 50.7% from friends. Trust in KOLs/Content Creators is extremely high. In-depth interviews reveal that users interviewed by Thao, Phong, and Khiem trust KOLs because their content feels "real," "relatable," and provides useful reviews, in contrast to mere advertisements. 1.2. Needs, Problems, and Desired Benefits (Jobs, Pains, and Gains) To build a truly valuable solution, it's essential to understand the "Jobs-to-be-Done" that customers are trying to accomplish, the "Pains" they encounter, and the "Gains" they aspire to. - Jobs-to-be-Done:
- Functional: "Choose daily outfits," "buy new clothes," "sell/liquidate old
clothes," "find an outfit for a specific event (date, interview, party)." - Social & Emotional: "Express personal style," "feel confident and shine,"
"fit in with friends," "be seen as trendy/fashionable," "make sustainable fashion choices." - Validated Pains:
- The "Wardrobe Full, Nothing to Wear" Paradox: This is the biggest and
most common pain. Users own many clothes but struggle to combine them into fresh, appealing outfits. This leads to decision fatigue and wasted resources. Phong's sharing about buying clothes and then "not knowing if they'll mix well with what I already have" is a perfect illustration of this problem. - Risky Online Shopping: The fear of buying unsuitable products online is a
huge barrier. This is the most frequently and intensely discussed issue. Surveys show the top 3 concerns are "Size discrepancies" (67.6%), "Actual product differs from photo" (57.7%), and "Material not as described" (56.3%). Interviewees also strongly emphasized this, stating it's a "big 41

problem because it's my money" and leads to the hassle of returns/exchanges. - Ineffective Second-hand Market: Users find current channels for selling
or exchanging clothes (like Facebook groups) inconvenient, unreliable, and prone to scams or "ghosting" customers. - Desired Gains:
- Confidence and Self-Expression: This is the ultimate goal. 57.6% of
survey participants "strongly agree" that a beautiful and suitable outfit helps them feel more confident. - Time and Cost Savings: A recurring theme. Users want to save time
choosing clothes every morning and save money by avoiding bad purchases and better utilizing their existing wardrobes. - Inspiration and Learning: Users actively want to learn how to style better.
Phong pointed out a market gap: "there's no app yet that combines shopping with joining a community to learn how to style." 1.3. Strategic Implications A deeper analysis of the data reveals significant strategic opportunities. It's clear that users don't lack inspiration; they are inundated with it from TikTok and Pinterest. The real problem lies in translating that external inspiration into a feasible reality using their own limited wardrobes. Thao's comment perfectly captures this: "Clothes online are beautiful, but when applied to what I have, even a slight difference creates a different vibe." This is the "gap between inspiration and execution" that OOTDverse must fill. Therefore, OOTDverse's main function is not just to provide more inspiration, but to become an execution tool . The Virtual Closet and AI Stylist are not just features, but central pillars of the entire value proposition, bridging what users see online and what they can wear in real life. Furthermore, the high interest in sharing OOTDs, participating in challenges (51.4% "very interested" in challenges with rewards), and learning from the community indicates a desire to shift from passive consumption to active creation and participation. They want to both consume and produce content. This implies that the business model must be designed around User-Generated Content (UGC). The community is not just a feature to increase engagement but a strategic asset for content creation, social proof, and long-term defensibility. This transforms customers from mere users into a vital part of the platform's value. 1.4. Customer Profile Synthesis 42

The table below clearly summarizes the world of the target customer, directly linking their goals with their frustrations and desires, ensuring user-centricity in all subsequent strategic decisions. Table 1: Customer Profile Synthesis Jobs-to-be-Done Validated Pains Desired Gains Choose daily "Don't know how to mix and Save time, feel confident outfits match," decision fatigue. every day.

VII.2. Value Propositions OOTDverse's value proposition must directly and strongly address the identified "pains" of customers. It is not a collection of disparate features, but an integrated ecosystem that delivers a clear promise. 2.1. Central Value Proposition: From Wardrobe Chaos to Shaped Confidence OOTDverse's core promise is: To transform users' existing wardrobes from a source of daily stress and confusion into a dynamic, intelligent, and interactive platform for creative expression, smart shopping, and sustainable fashion choices. OOTDverse empowers users to unlock the full potential of what they already own and to shop for new items with absolute confidence. 2.2. Linking Features to Customer Problems Each key feature of OOTDverse is designed to solve a specific problem validated through research. - AI Stylist (AI Assistant) - Solves "I have nothing to wear" & "Decision fatigue."
- This feature directly tackles the core pain of not knowing how to combine
existing clothes. Almost all interviewees expressed strong interest, seeing it as a way to save time and be more creative with their basic items. The survey reinforces this, with "AI outfit suggestions" being the most desired technology application (45.1%). - AR Virtual Try-On - Solves "Fear of making online shopping mistakes."
- This is the direct antidote to the biggest risk in online shopping. It addresses
users' top three fears: wrong size (67.6%), actual product differs from image (57.7%), and not suiting body shape (38%). Users see this as a way to experiment with new colors and styles without risk, while Phong considers it a tool to "significantly reduce return risks." 47.9% of survey participants believe this feature "definitely" helps them feel more confident when shopping online. - Virtual Closet - The Platform for Personalization.
- This feature is the foundational element that allows the AI Stylist to deliver
its core value. It transforms generic advice into hyper-personalized recommendations. It solves Phong's problem of buying a new item and not knowing if it will match his existing clothes. Users' willingness to upload their wardrobes (60.6% "completely agree if quick & secure operation") shows high acceptance for this fundamental step. - Marketplace (Second-hand Market) - Solves "Fashion waste" & "Ineffective
resale." 44

- This feature provides a reliable, streamlined alternative to the chaotic and
risky process of selling on Facebook groups, a pain point mentioned by Thao and Phong. It taps into the existing behavior of buying/selling used items (a total of 78.8% do so at least "rarely"). - Community & Gamification - Solves "Lack of reliable guidance" & "Boredom."
- This feature meets the desire for social learning and interaction. It provides
the platform Phong wished for, combining shopping with a community for learning. Strong interest in challenges indicates a demand for interactive, fun, and rewarding fashion experiences. 2.3. In-depth Analysis and Strategic Implications When analyzing users' willingness to pay and their most severe pains, a common theme emerges: risk. There's financial risk in buying the wrong item (Thao), social risk in wearing an unflattering or inappropriate outfit, and time risk in endless browsing and decision-making. In essence, every core OOTDverse feature is a risk mitigation tool. The AI Stylist reduces "fashion faux pas" risk. AR Try-On reduces the financial risk of a bad purchase. The Community provides social proof, reducing the risk of trying a new style. This implies that marketing messages and products should be built around confidence, certainty, and "smart fashion." Instead of selling "AI," OOTDverse should sell "The end of the 'I hope it fits' question." Furthermore, these features are deeply interconnected and create a positive feedback loop. A user uploads clothes to their Virtual Closet , this data is fed to the AI Stylist . The AI Stylist suggests an outfit but identifies a missing item, leading the user to the Marketplace . The user uses AR Try-On to validate the purchase. When they wear the outfit, they share it with the Community , which in turn inspires other users and restarts the cycle. Therefore, the competitive advantage (defensive moat) of the business lies not in any single feature, but in the strong network effect created by their integration. This makes the platform increasingly valuable and retains users better as more people join and contribute data. 2.4. Value Proposition Linkage The table below creates an undeniable, evidence-based link between product features and validated customer problems, ensuring that development resources are focused on what truly matters to users. Table 2: Value Proposition Linkage 45

VII.3. Channels OOTDverse's channel strategy must focus on reaching the target customer where they frequently spend time, using formats and messages they trust. 3.1. Awareness and Acquisition Channels: Social Media Priority Strategy - Primary Channels: TikTok & Instagram. The data is undeniable. These are the main
platforms where the target audience discovers trends and seeks fashion inspiration (80.3% TikTok, 56.3% Instagram). Therefore, the strategy must be organic and aligned with these platforms. - Content Format: Short Videos and Authentic Reviews. Users are most attracted to
"quick try-on videos (haul/try-on)" and "livestream reviews" because they are visual, authentic, and show how clothes look on real people in motion. Static images are less effective. - Message Carriers: KOLs/Content Creators. These are the most trusted voices. The
strategy must focus on building relationships with a range of fashion creators, from micro-influencers to established KOLs. As suggested by Phong and Khiem, collaboration with KOLs is essential to create buzz and credibility. 3.2. Distribution and Sales Channels - Primary Platform: OOTDverse Website/Mobile App. This is the central hub where
all value is delivered—from AI styling to AR try-on and marketplace transactions. It is a closed ecosystem. - E-commerce Integration: Although OOTDverse has its own marketplace,
partnering and integrating with major platforms like Shopee and TikTok Shop (where users already shop) could be a powerful channel for affiliate revenue and user acquisition. 3.3. Strategic Implications Given the audience's content consumption habits, OOTDverse cannot simply advertise on TikTok; OOTDverse must become a content creator on TikTok. The platform's own social media channels should produce exactly the type of content users love: "1 item, 5 ways to style" videos created by the AI Stylist, "Before/After" videos using the app, and highlighting the best OOTDs from the community. This requires the marketing team to be structured like a media production unit, focusing on creating a large volume of engaging short video content that showcases the app's power in an entertaining and non-overtly salesy way. 47

VII.4. Customer Relationships The relationship OOTDverse builds with its users must go beyond a mere transaction. It must be a partnership, where the platform provides tools and a community to support users on their journey of style expression. 4.1. Type of Relationship: Personalized Assistant and Co-creative Community - High Level of Personalization: The relationship begins with the AI Stylist acting
as an automated, personal stylist. The system learns the user's style, body shape, and existing wardrobe to provide tailored advice. Users are willing to provide important personal data (photos, body measurements, style preferences) to activate this feature, with 68.6% willing to share photos and measurements. - Co-creation within the Community: The relationship evolves from a service
provider to a community facilitator. OOTDverse provides tools and a platform for users to connect, share, and learn from each other. This fosters a sense of belonging and transforms users from customers into community members. - Gamification: The use of challenges, leaderboards, and rewards creates a fun,
competitive, and highly engaging experience. The survey shows a strong demand for this, with 51.4% "very interested" and another 28.6% "interested" in challenges with rewards. 4.2. Strategic Implications The entire business model depends on users uploading photos of clothes and providing personal data. Although the survey shows a high level of willingness, this trust is fragile. Therefore, the initial onboarding process is extremely crucial for building trust . The initial user experience must be exceptionally smooth, transparent about data privacy, and demonstrate immediate value. For example, the first time a user uploads 3 items, the AI should immediately generate an appealing outfit to create an "aha!" moment. This requires significant UX/UI resource investment in the onboarding flow, transforming it from a tedious data entry process into an engaging, personalized style quiz that delivers instant gratification. VII.5. Revenue Streams 48

OOTDverse's revenue model must balance attracting a large user base with generating sustainable revenue. Research data shows a clear path to achieving this. 5.1. Primary Revenue Stream: Freemium Subscription Model - Core Idea: Offer a robust free version to attract a large number of users and drive
network effects, along with an attractive Premium package for active users. - Data Validation: This model is strongly supported by the survey. While 48.6% want
to use it for free, a total of 70% of users are willing to pay a monthly fee (under 99,000 VND). The optimal price point is clearly the package under 49,000 VND/month, chosen by 44.3% of respondents. - Package Definitions:
- Free Tier: Basic Virtual Closet (limited uploads), standard AI outfit
suggestions, community access. - Premium Tier (<99k/month): Unlimited wardrobe uploads, advanced AI
Stylist (suggestions based on personal colors, specific events, advanced styling tips like "how to tuck in, roll up sleeves"), unlimited AR Try-On, exclusive access to challenges or rewards. - Reasons to Pay: Users see a clear return on investment. Interviewees clearly stated
they are willing to pay because "if those features truly help me avoid 1-2 failed purchases... then that fee is completely worth it." 5.2. Secondary Revenue Stream: Marketplace Transaction Fees - Model: Charge a small commission (e.g., 5-10%) on all successful transactions
(buy/sell/exchange) conducted through the second-hand marketplace. - Reason: OOTDverse provides significant value compared to free options like
Facebook by offering a trustworthy environment, secure payments ("Holding intermediary funds for safe refunds" is a key trust factor for 32.9% of users), and a target audience of fashion lovers. 5.3. Potential Revenue Streams (Future Development) - B2B Partnerships / Affiliate Revenue: Collaborate with fashion brands to feature
their products as "suggested additional purchases" in AI Stylist recommendations. This aligns with Khiem's interest in receiving brand/trend-based suggestions. - Analytics Data as a Service: Anonymized and aggregated data on fashion trends,
popular outfit combinations, and regional style preferences could be a valuable product for fashion brands and retailers. 5.4. Strategic Implications 49

The Premium subscription package is not merely about "unlocking features," but about "Confidence as a Service." Willingness to pay is directly proportional to the perceived risk reduction for users. The free version helps you organize, but the premium version actively prevents you from making mistakes. It's the difference between a filing cabinet and a financial advisor. Therefore, marketing for the Premium package should focus on results: "Never again 'what to wear today' crisis," "Online shopping without regret," "Unlock your true style potential." It sells an emotional benefit (confidence) and a financial benefit (no more wasted money), which justifies a recurring fee. VII.6. Key Activities These are the most important actions OOTDverse must undertake to operate its business model. - Platform Development and Maintenance: The core activity is continuous
improvement of the website/app, especially AI and AR technologies. This includes refining algorithms, fixing bugs, and enhancing UX to ensure a "smooth" platform. - AI/ML Model Training: Continuously feed new data to the AI (from user-uploaded
photos, brand product catalogs, trend analysis) to make its suggestions smarter, more creative, and more personalized. - Community Management and Content Curation: Actively manage the community
space, organize gamified challenges, moderate content, and highlight top user contributions to foster a positive and engaging environment. - Business Development and Partnerships: Build and manage relationships with
fashion brands, retailers, and KOLs. VII.7. Key Resources These are the most important assets required to make the business model work. - Proprietary Technology and Data: AI styling algorithms, AR rendering technology,
and most importantly, a growing proprietary dataset of user wardrobes and style preferences. This user-generated data is the ultimate competitive advantage and the driver of the network effect. - Human Resources: A skilled team comprising AI/ML engineers, software
developers (with AR experience), UX/UI designers, community managers, and fashion experts/stylists. - Brand and Community: The OOTDverse brand and its loyal, active user
community are crucial intangible assets that grow in value over time. 50

VII.8. Key Partnerships OOTDverse cannot succeed alone. Building a network of strategic partners is crucial to accelerate growth and enhance value for users. - KOLs / Fashion Content Creators: Not just a marketing channel, but strategic
partners to create content, capture trends, and build authenticity. This is a direct suggestion from many interviewees. - Fashion Brands and Retailers (especially local brands): Essential to enrich the
marketplace, provide accurate product data for AR Try-On, and offer exclusive deals/vouchers to the OOTDverse community. Phong's suggestion of partnering with "local brands & micro-influencers" is a very viable starting point. - Payment Gateways and Logistics Service Providers: Important to ensure smooth,
secure, and reliable transactions within the marketplace. - Strategic Implications
A symbiotic partnership model needs to be built. OOTDverse needs partners, but partners also need OOTDverse. For KOLs, the platform provides a new way to interact with their audience and monetize their styling skills. For local brands, OOTDverse is a hyper-targeted marketing channel that allows customers to "virtually try on" their products, significantly reducing a major barrier to online sales. Therefore, the partnership strategy should be built as a win-win relationship. OOTDverse can provide brands with unparalleled data on which styles resonate with their target audience and a direct path to purchase, making it a powerful business development partner, not just another place to advertise. VII.9. Cost Structure The cost structure describes all expenses incurred to operate the business model. For OOTDverse, costs will be heavily focused on technology and talent. 9.1. Key Cost Elements (Technology and Talent Driven) - Personnel Costs: This will be the largest cost category. Salaries for highly
specialized technical teams (AI/ML engineers, AR developers, full-stack developers) and the team needed to manage the platform (community, marketing, business development). 51

- Technology and Infrastructure: Costs for cloud hosting services (servers, databases)
capable of handling large volumes of images and data processing for AI/AR features. Licensing fees for any third-party software or APIs. 9.2. Growth and Operating Costs - Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): A significant budget for marketing and
advertising, primarily focused on digital channels (TikTok, Instagram) and KOL collaboration fees. - Community and Content: Costs related to operating the community, including
rewards for challenges (vouchers, Premium packages) and potentially a budget for internal content creation. 9.3. Strategic Implications The cost structure is highly front-loaded. The most significant costs are in R&D and platform development, occurring before substantial revenue can be generated. Marketing spend to acquire critical initial user volume will also be substantial. However, once the platform is built and the community reaches a certain scale, the marginal cost to serve an additional user is relatively low. This implies that the business requires a significant initial capital investment. The financial model must account for a high "burn rate" period before subscription and transaction revenue streams can scale to profitability. The focus in the early stages must be on user growth and engagement to build the data asset, which will drive long-term value. VII.10.Conclusion The business model developed for OOTDverse, based on extensive market research data, shows strong potential and a clear problem-solution fit. The platform addresses the real and persistent "pains" of the target Gen Z customer segment, while leveraging their inherent behaviors and desires. Key Conclusions: 1. High Market Fit: There is a clear and urgent need for an integrated solution that
helps young people manage their wardrobes, get personalized styling inspiration, reduce online shopping risks, and participate in a sustainable fashion community. 2. Competitive Advantage from Ecosystem, Not Features: OOTDverse's true strength
lies not in AI or AR individually, but in how these features combine to create a value loop and network effect, making the platform more valuable as more users join. 52

3. Freemium Revenue Model is Feasible: Data shows that users are willing to pay a
reasonable monthly fee in exchange for core values such as time savings, reduced financial risk, and enhanced confidence. Projected Strategy: 1. Prioritize Onboarding Experience: Initial success depends on convincing users to
trust and invest time in digitizing their wardrobes. Invest heavily in a smooth, engaging, and instantly valuable onboarding process to overcome initial barriers. 2. Build Community First, Monetize Later: Focus on building a vibrant and engaged
community through user-generated content, challenges, and KOL participation. A strong community will be the foundation for user retention and driving long-term revenue streams. 3. Market as a Content Creator: Instead of traditional advertising, invest in producing
authentic, short video content suitable for TikTok and Instagram. Let the product itself (through AI styling videos) become the most effective marketing tool. 4. Start with Small Strategic Partners: Instead of targeting large brands immediately,
follow research suggestions and partner with local brands and micro-influencers. This approach will help build authenticity, create successful case studies, and optimize initial costs. In summary, OOTDverse has a clear roadmap to become an indispensable platform in the fashion lives of Vietnamese youth. By focusing on excellent execution of this data-driven business model, OOTDverse can build a sustainable, scalable, and truly valuable business. ### VIII. Marketing mix strategy

3. Ensure high measurability for all activities before scaling up nationally.
### IX. Break even point & payback
IX.1. Revenue Model – IAP & IAA Structure 1.1 Overview of the Revenue Model 55

OOTDverse applies a hybrid revenue model combining IAP (In-App Purchase) and IAA (In-App Advertising) - a model widely used in Gen Z–oriented tech platforms such as Spotify, Duolingo, or Canva. This approach enables OOTDverse to maintain both broad accessibility and stable revenue growth. - IAP (In-App Purchase): Paid users gain full access to premium features such as
unlimited AI Styling, 3D AR Try-On, and personalized fashion recommendations. - IAA (In-App Advertising): Free users access core features supported by ads,
affiliate links, and sponsored content. This dual model helps OOTDverse achieve three strategic goals: 1. Increase brand reach through a large base of free users.
2. Generate stable recurring revenue from paid subscriptions.
3. Leverage behavioral fashion data to train AI systems and attract brand partnership.
1.2. Product Plan & Key Features Model Product Plan Key Features User Ratio Price (VND/month) IAP Paid User - Full access to 20% 99,000 (Premium) outfit library (3D, trends, events). - Unlimited AI

- Indirect revenue from ads and brand partnerships (IAA).
This structure ensures diversified income streams, reducing dependency on a single customer segment. b. Aligned with Gen Z behavior: Over 70% of Gen Z prefer trying free versions before upgrading, making IAA a natural onboarding mechanism toward paid plans. Gamified promotions such as OOTD Challenges and 7-day Premium Trials can further increase conversion rates by 10–15%. c. Student affordability: Vietnamese Gen Z typically spend 50k–100k VND/month on digital services, making the 99k Premium plan affordable while maintaining perceived value (AI + AR + brand perks). 57

1.4. Model Evaluation Criteria IAP IAA Overall Impact Revenue stability High Variable Balanced growth and sustainability Operational cost Higher (AI/AR Lower Flexible scaling APIs) User growth Steady Rapid Ensures short- and long-term growth Fashion behavior Deep insights Broad Enhances AI recommendation data trends accuracy 1.5.Conclusion The hybrid IAP–IAA model offers a sustainable structure for student-led tech startups: - IAA ensures reach and virality,
- IAP guarantees profitability and system maintenance.
Together, they enable OOTDverse to expand community size while maintaining financial stability. IX.2. Financial Projections (Year 1) EXE101 - OOTDverse 2.1. REVENUE FORECAST 1.1. Business Model Overview OOTDverse operates on a hybrid revenue model combining: - Freemium subscriptions (Premium plan)

within campus environments. X.2. Do We Make Products? X.2.1. Development Process - Discovery (1–2 weeks): Identify user scenarios (Gen Z VN), define success metrics
(activation, outfit-suggestion CTR, AR try-on rate). - Design: Wireframe for AI Stylist flow → outfit suggestions → AR try-on;
prioritize mobile UI/UX standards. - Build (2-week sprint, trunk-based):
- Frontend: Next.js (app/pages), Tailwind; suggestion state machine
(intentFromQuery, normalizeAnalysis, buildPool, score). - API Gateway: Next.js API Route (/api/generateOutfit) as server-side proxy
calling Gemini JSON mode; API key protected in server env. - Validate: Automated testing:
- Unit tests for intentFromQuery, normalizeAnalysis, scoreOutfitWithAI.
- Integration with mocked Gemini to check 200/4xx/5xx, invalid JSON. Add
tests with free tier rate limits to avoid quota errors (e.g., mock calls with 10 RPM limit for 2.5-flash). 67

- Release: CI/CD (GitHub Actions → Vercel). Each branch creates a preview URL;
release-* tags auto-deploy to production. - Operate: Structured logging, error alerts (Sentry/Logtail), canary (5%) before 100%
rollout. - Prompt/Safety Governance: Versioned prompt templates; content controls (no PII
sent), regression testing when models change. Principles for reducing AI calls: Debounce input, cache by {normalizedQuery + profileHash}, fallback to local (rule-based) on network errors. X.2.2. Architecture & How OOTDverse Uses Gemini API Request flow (simplified): - Client (Dashboard): User types description → handleAISearch() → POST
/api/generateOutfit (body: { userQuery, profile }). - API Route: Check POST, get GEMINI_API_KEY, build prompt “return pure
JSON” and call Generative Language API: POST 68

https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generat eContent with responseMimeType: "application/json". - Gemini returns: candidates[0].content.parts[0].text (JSON). API parses, removes
code fences if present, and returns raw JSON to client. - Client merges: textIntent (from natural Vietnamese) + Gemini JSON →
normalizeAnalysis. → buildPool() filters by allowed/banned + weather, relaxes if few results. → scoreOutfitWithAI() (weights: occasion 40, style 25, weather 15, mood 12, colors 8; +5 if matches preferences). → Sort & get Top 12, generate aiReasoning, render. Why choose gemini-2.5-flash: Supports 1M context window, “thinking budgets”, suitable for reasoning tasks + stable JSON mode. In free tier, input/output tokens are free with rate limits (10 RPM, 250,000 TPM, 250 RPD). When upgrading to paid, input $0.30/1M tokens (text/image/video), output $2.50/1M; includes Batch API reducing ~50% (input $0.15, output $1.25) and context caching $0.03/1M tokens to save on repeated contexts. Cost-saving options: In free tier, use gemini-2.5-flash-lite (higher rate limits: 15 RPM, 250,000 TPM, 1,000 RPD) or gemini-2.0-flash (15 RPM, 1M TPM, 200 RPD) to optimize free throughput. When paid, gemini-2.5-flash-lite (input $0.10/1M, output $0.40/1M) suitable for quick/high-volume suggestions; gemini-2.0-flash (input $0.10, output $0.40) still viable if no need for 2.5 reasoning. X.2.3. Quota Plan (Free Tier) & Capacity; Upgrade to Paid - Free Tier Quota Table : Gemini 2.5 Flash (10 RPM, 250k TPM, 250 RPD);
Flash-Lite (15 RPM, 250k TPM, 1k RPD); 2.0 Flash (15 RPM, 1M TPM, 200 RPD). Tokens are free, but content is used to improve products. - On Paid Upgrade (Tier 1) : Higher limits (e.g., 2.5 Flash: 1k RPM, 1M TPM, 10k
RPD). Costs (USD/1M tokens): 2.5 Flash ($0.30 input/$2.50 output, Batch reduces 50%); Flash-Lite/2.0 Flash ($0.10 input/$0.40 output). - Estimated Scenario : For 2k users, 3 queries/day, 30 days → 180k calls/month
(600 input + 120 output tokens/query). Free 2.5 Flash may exceed quotas (monitor & fallback needed); paid est. ~$86.4/month (no Batch) or $43.2 (with Batch); Flash-Lite/2.0 Flash ~$19.4/month. For longer prompts: ~$144/$32.4. Currently free (no costs, quota limits); upgrade via 'Configurer la facturation' to unlock Batch, caching, higher limits, and disable content use for improvements. X.2.4. Operations, Security & Compliance - Key Security : Store GEMINI_API_KEY in server env (Vercel/Cloud Run secrets);
do not commit. - Reduce Quota Risks : Local cache {query + profileHash} (no context caching in
free); use Flash-Lite for high loads (15 RPM > 10 RPM Flash); paid adds Batch (50% cost cut). Limit IP/user to avoid free quota breaches (e.g., 250 RPD for Flash); circuit-breaker to rule-based fallback near limits. 69

- Monitoring : Structured logs (request ID, Gemini latency, token usage, cache ratio).
- Privacy : Anonymize identifiers; no face photos without consent. Free: Content
used for improvements; paid: Disable this feature. X.2.5. Technical Roadmap 1. Q1 : Complete AI Stylist JSON mode, caching, stats dashboard; optimize VN
prompts (tone, weather). 2. Q2 : AR Try-On (photo/live) + segmentation pipeline; integrate Marketplace (KYC
with .edu email). 3. Q3 : Rule-based precompute outfits; A/B test 2.5 Flash vs Flash-Lite on free quotas;
optimize throughput. 4. Q4 : Upgrade to paid for context caching + Grounding (Search) on weather/brand
suggestions (initial 1.5k RPD grounding); scale to 10k DAU (budget per paid table). X.2.6. Why Trust This Approach? - MVP Running: Prototype with outfit suggestions & basic AR; beta 200+ users at
FPT. - Clear Pipeline, Controllable Costs: JSON mode + cache + Batch for transparent
budgeting. - Flexible: Switch models (2.5 Flash ↔ Flash-Lite/2.0 Flash) by quality/cost; easy
third-party SDK integration (Vue.ai, ZMO). - Current Free Tier: Limited quotas; beta fits (no >250 RPD for Flash), scalable via
paid upgrade. X.3. Can We Make Money? X.3.1. Market & Growth Potential - TAM (Total Addressable Market):
Vietnam has approximately 28 million Gen Z users (aged 16–26). Around 60% are interested in online fashion and outfit styling → TAM ≈ 16.8 million potential users. - SAM (Serviceable Available Market):
Each user spends an average of 1.5 million VND/year on online fashion. → SAM = 5,000 × 1.5 million = 7.5 billion VND (~300,000 USD). - SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):
Target for the first year: capture 4% of SAM → approximately 2,000 initial users. X.3.2. Business Model 70
