**OOTDverse - The Smart Wardrobe Website for Young People** 
### **I - What is OOTDverse ?** 
OOTDverse is a smart fashion website for young people, where each of you can turn your wardrobe into a virtual wardrobe and explore a creative world of online outfits. 

1. **Problem and Solution** 

**The Problem:** Young people, especially Gen Z and students, often face fashion-related challenges. They have many clothes but find it difficult to style new outfits. They frequently buy clothes online that don't fit well, leading to wasted money. Additionally, it's hard to sell or exchange old clothes that they no longer wear. 

**The Solution:** OOTDverse is a fashion website that integrates AI and augmented reality (AR) technology to solve these problems. The platform helps users manage a virtual wardrobe, get smart outfit suggestions, try on clothes online, buy and sell items, and engage with a fashion-loving community. 

2. **Key Features** 
- **Virtual Closet:** Users can upload photos of their clothes. AI will automatically categorize them into types like tops, pants, dresses, shoes, and accessories. You can also manually drag and drop items to create outfits. 
- **AI Stylist:** This feature provides outfit suggestions based on several factors, including the occasion (school, going out, part-time job, party) , personal style (streetwear, casual, sporty, elegant) , and even personal color to match your skin tone. 
- **Virtual Try-On:** Users can upload a portrait photo or use an AR camera to "try on" clothes. The AI/AR technology will "superimpose" items from their virtual closet or the marketplace onto their body. This applies not just to single items but also to the outfits suggested by the AI Stylist, helping users visualize and reduce the risk of unsatisfactory online purchases. 
- **Marketplace (Buy & Sell - Exchange):** OOTDverse creates a small marketplace for students and young people to post clothes and accessories they no longer use for sale. The platform also supports swapping items within the community and facilitates payments via QR codes or e-wallets. 
- **Community & Gamification:** Users can post their outfits (OOTD), receive likes and votes from the community , and participate in leaderboards for "hottest outfits". Challenges like "Mix 7 days with 7 items" will help create trends and attract users. 
3. **The meaning of project name :**  

The meaning of the project name OOTDverse is formed from two elements: OOTD and Verse. 

- OOTD (Outfit Of The Day) 

This is a very popular hashtag on social networking platforms such as Instagram and TikTok. When hearing about OOTD, young people will immediately think of fashion, outfit coordination and personal style. 

- Verse (from Metaverse) 

This term means a virtual world or space where people can experience and interact with each other. The use of "Verse" suggests a "digital fashion universe", where users can not only view outfits but also try on clothes online, build virtual wardrobes and interact in a community. 

- Combination: OOTDverse 

This combination creates the meaning of "The World of Outfit Of The Day" - a virtual space where young people can not only share outfits but also mix and match clothes with the support of AI, try on clothes with AR technology, and make fashion transactions and exchanges. This name sounds modern, trendy and close to Gen Z, while still expressing the core technology element of the project.
